# Qlik-Sense-QWT-Project-
This is end to end project of QWT by using qlik sense. Qlik sense in Built ETL facility through which we can do Data Cleansing,Data modeling  and visualization at the same place.

I have Created an Visualization app by analysing and modeling the QWT DATA  Which draws the insight for business decision making.
I have attached the zip file which consists QVDs following  3 tier architecture which is Etract, Transform and Load. 
There is also qvd makers in zip format which contain another apps in which i tranformed the data through Qlik scripting.

# **3 Tier Architecture**
It contains the process of ETL which is Extract, Transform and Load.
Stage1 Consists Extraction of data from different sources in seperate apps.
Stage2 Consists Tranformation like Data Cleansing, Nullvalue Treatment, Renaming Columns in seperate apps.
Stage3 consists Data Modeling in which we prepare the data model and treat various relationship errors like Circular reference, and Synthetic keys 

Note: there is not such hard or thumb rule but we follow this to maintain hygine in our system this kind of BestPractices.
